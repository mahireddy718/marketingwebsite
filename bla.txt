✅ Phase 1 — Core Functionality Finalization (High Priority)
1️⃣ Cart system (fully functional)

You’ve already started this, but let’s make it enterprise-grade:

Add → Cart

Remove → Cart

Update quantity

Persist in localStorage

Sync with backend for logged-in users

Auto-clear on logout (you already asked for this 👍)

Deliverable: A clean CartContext + reusable cart service.

2️⃣ Product Page Enhancements

Right now product cards only show name + image.
Next-level UX:

Product detail page (/product/:id)

Image zoom

Add to cart from inside product page

Show similar items

Auto-scroll to reviews

3️⃣ Authentication Flow Upgrade

Your login/signup works — now we refine:

Protect /cart and /checkout if user is not logged in

Auto-fill username in navbar

JWT expiry handling

Error-handling UI instead of raw alerts

✅ Phase 2 — Backend Strengthening
4️⃣ Product Filtering & Sort

Just like Flipkart:

Sort by price (low→high, high→low)

Filter by brand

Filter by availability

Pagination (20 products per page)

5️⃣ Search Engine Improvement

Move from exact match to:

fuzzy matching

category + tags search

result prioritization

✅ Phase 3 — Admin Panel (Big upgrade)

If you want to sell products, you need:

6️⃣ Admin dashboard

Add/edit/delete products

Bulk CSV upload (you already started)

Order management

Inventory management

We can build it with React + Tailwind + charts.

⚙️ Phase 4 — Production Optimization
7️⃣ Performance Boost

Image lazy loading

Component code splitting

CDN for images

Minimize bundle with Vite/ESBuild

Lighthouse audit (I can do one via code simulation)

8️⃣ Deployment

Options:

Frontend: Vercel / Netlify

Backend: Render / Railway / AWS

DB: MongoDB Atlas

Setup environment variables

Add HTTPS

Custom domain


add admin page
